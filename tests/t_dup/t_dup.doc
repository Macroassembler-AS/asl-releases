+------------------------- Test Application DUP -----------------------------+
|                                                                            |
|  Funny (and amazing) what weird issues users find: DUP is a keyword for    |
|  the "Intel/MASM-style" DB/DW/DD... instructions, namely to duplicate the  |
|  parenthized argument n times.  However, if you don't care about this      |
|  feature, but you have a symbol of this name?  Well, you may put DUP into  |
|  parentheses itself, which will protect DUP from being detected as         |
|  keyword.  Starting with Build 202, there is some additional logic that    |
|  will detect the duplicate operator only if there is a non-blank           |
|  duplication count argument in front of DUP.  This is checked in this test |
|  case.                                                                     |
|                                                                            |
